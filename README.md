# Auto-Clicker-code-in-Python3-with-pyautogui
this simple code can click where ever your cursor is how ever many times you want how ever fast you want
to edit the speed and amount of times this clicks you will need to do the following:
find the pyautogui.PAUSE(x.xx) code and change those numbers to set the speed. it is measured in seconds
to change how many times it clicks find line 10 and change the number in for i in range(xxx): and that will determine how many times it clicks. be careful with this number!!
